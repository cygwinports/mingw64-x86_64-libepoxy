VERSION=1.4.3
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="OpenGL abstraction library for Win64 toolchain"
DESCRIPTION="Epoxy is a library for handling OpenGL function pointer management
for you. It hides the complexity of dlopen(), dlsym(), glXGetProcAddress(),
eglGetProcAddress(), etc. from the app developer, with very little knowledge
needed on their part. They get to read GL specs and write code using undecorated
function names like glCompileShader()."
